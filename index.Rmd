# Things I am doing
* Getting a master's in data science

* Working on my capstone project (Unsupervised Learning for MS):
  * Autosegmentation of brain lesions using standard clustering as well as deep methods
  * Prediction of entire brain (PET scan) using autosegmented MRIs and GANs
  * Grouping of MS patients using time based features, unsupervised, and semisupervised methods (likely bayesian as well)
  * Prediction of MS relapses

* Helping graduate students succeed and understand the entire data science workflow from data attainment to deployment (head TA for a survey of data science course)

* Going in depth with deep learning
  * Building fake images of food with a GAN  (future blog post)
  * Working on image classification with CNNs
  * Time series analysis with LSTMs and WaveNet CNN architecture
  * (Hopefully) building a chess AI that uses reinforcement learning


# Things I have done

* Worked for NASA

  * Acted as translator, astronomer, and lead scout for the [ultima thule mission](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-team-strikes-gold-in-argentina/)

  * [Conducted televised interviews in Argentina](https://twitter.com/UVaOccultChaser/status/885859356054622209)

* Performed [extensive time series analysis](https://github.com/josephsdavid/ChinesePM) of $PM_{2.5}$ content in Beijing, using models ranging from ARIMA and VAR to LSTMs, and ensembling methods

* Conducted [ARM using R](https://github.com/drake-smu/7331-lab-3) on census data, yielding unsurprising results

* Extensively done [classification on census data using python](https://github.com/drake-smu/7331-lab-2)
